        <p>
            I am a software developer with over three years of experience designing and developing scalable
            applications. My work includes creating RESTful APIs, dynamic user interfaces, and optimizing database
            systems. After relocating to the U.S. and taking a career break to prioritize my family, I worked as a
            Preschool Teacher, which helped me cultivate strong communication, time management, and teamwork skills.
            I am excited to apply my technical expertise and leadership skills to impactful IT solutions.
